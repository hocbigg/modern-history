- **Regional Modern Histories**  
  This track contains separate modules for Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the United States.  
  You do **not** need to study every region. Pick **1–3** regions that interest you most (or that seem most relevant to your goals — for example, the history of your own region, regions connected to current events, or areas you want to understand better).

- **Thematic and Analytical Modern History**  
  This track contains focused modules on major forces that shaped the modern world: empire & colonialism, war & revolution, society & culture, economy & environment.  
  Again, you do **not** need to read every theme. Choose **2–4** themes that excite you or help you make sense of the topics you care about.

You can move back and forth between regional and thematic sections as needed — they reinforce each other. For example, reading about colonialism (Section IV) becomes much clearer after you have studied modern Africa or Asia (Section III).
