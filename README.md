## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

Complete these sections in the following sequence:

**Section I: Historical Method and Historiography**: Start here. This section teaches you how historians think, read sources, and build arguments. It is the foundation for everything else.

**Section II: Global Chronological Foundations (c. 1750–Present)**: Next, get the big-picture timeline and major global transformations of the modern era. This gives you the overall framework you will refer to throughout the rest of your studies.

**Section V: Late Modern & Contemporary History**: Finish the core by bringing the story up to the very recent past and the world we live in today. This section ties the earlier periods together and helps you see long-term patterns.

### Specialization Tracks

The remaining sections (III and IV) are specialization tracks. They allow you to go much deeper into specific regions or important themes.

- **Section III: Regional Modern Histories**  
  This track contains separate modules for Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the United States.  
  You do **not** need to study every region. Pick **1–3** regions that interest you most (or that seem most relevant to your goals — for example, the history of your own region, regions connected to current events, or areas you want to understand better).

- **Section IV: Thematic and Analytical Modern History**  
  This track contains focused modules on major forces that shaped the modern world: empire & colonialism, war & revolution, society & culture, economy & environment.  
  Again, you do **not** need to read every theme. Choose **2–4** themes that excite you or help you make sense of the topics you care about.

You can move back and forth between regional and thematic sections as needed — they reinforce each other. For example, reading about colonialism (Section IV) becomes much clearer after you have studied modern Africa or Asia (Section III).
