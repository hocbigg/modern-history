## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

Complete these sections in the following sequence:

**Historical Method and Historiography**: Start here. This section teaches you how historians think, read sources, and build arguments. It is the foundation for everything else.

**Global Chronological Foundations (c. 1750–Present)**: Next, get the big-picture timeline and major global transformations of the modern era. This gives you the overall framework you will refer to throughout the rest of your studies.

**The Twentieth Century: Wars, Ideologies, and Global Shifts (c. 1914–1991)**: Covers the era of world wars, revolutions, decolonization, and Cold War – essential bridge to the contemporary world.

**Late Modern & Contemporary History**: Finish the core by bringing the story up to the very recent past and the world we live in today. This section ties the earlier periods together and helps you see long-term patterns.
